**PyConf Hyderabad** is the premier regional gathering for the Python community, bringing together those who use and develop the open-source Python programming language. Organized by the [Hyderabad Python User Group (HydPy)](https://www.hydpy.org/), this conference fosters knowledge sharing, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas, strengthening connections between developers and users through meaningful interactions.

Since its inception in [2017](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2017/), PyConf Hyderabad has grown steadily, with successful editions in [2019](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2019/), [2020](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2020/), [2022](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2022/) and [2025](https://2025.pyconfhyd.org/).

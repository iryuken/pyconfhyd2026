## Talks

Talks should be 30 minutes long (including Q\&A – 5 mins) and can be on any topic related to Python.

## Workshops

Workshops are 180 mins long interactive sessions where attendees can learn by doing.

## Format

- The format of each talk will be up to the speaker but should include a mix of lectures, demos, and Q\&A.
- **Workshops** are aimed at beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience-level participants.
- **Workshop** proposals must include a detailed outline of the covered topics and allocated time.

## Schedule

The full schedule with detailed information will be published separately.

## What to Propose

Any topics of interest to Python programmers, with a focus on the following but not limited to:

- Lessons learned from using Python in projects, including unconventional and conventional wisdom and advice for similar problem-solving. E.g., I tried Python for video processing or in my medical imaging project, and here are the lessons.
- Contributions to improving the Python language/ecosystem, such as creating libraries or proposing optimizations.
- Knowledge gained from other languages, like type systems, functional programming patterns, or logic programming.
- Thoughts on tech culture, diversity and inclusiveness, the physical and mental health of programmers, productivity improvement, workplace issues, and their impact when using Python.
- Alternatively, consider offering teaching sessions on niche topics, recent technologies, or scientific papers, even at a beginner level.

Proposals can belong but not limited to any of the below topics:

1. **Developer tools and automation** \- Tools and practices for automating development workflows and enhancing productivity like DevOps, Testing, CI/CD, Containers, Orchestration, Logging, and Monitoring, Selenium
